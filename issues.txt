1. User Management and Role-Based Access Control
Objective: Implement a user management system that allows administrators to create and manage user accounts, assign roles, and control access to various modules.
Features:
•	User Creation:
o	Admins should be able to create new user accounts for different staff members (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists).
o	Capture essential user details such as name, contact information, and role.
•	Role Assignment:
o	Admins should assign specific roles to users, defining their access rights to each module.
o	Pre-defined roles should include:
	Doctor: Access to OPD/Consultation and Laboratory modules.
	Nurse: Access to Admissions and OPD/Consultation modules.
	Pharmacist: Access to Pharmacy module.
	Administrative Staff: Access to Admissions and general administrative functions.
•	Role Management:
o	Admins should be able to define and manage roles, specifying permissions for each role within the modules.
o	Permissions include read-only, read-write, and administrative access.
•	User Management Interface:
o	Provide a user-friendly interface for viewing, editing, and deleting user accounts.
o	Include audit trails to track changes in user roles and permissions.
2. Modular System Design
Objective: Develop a modular system where the following components can be enabled or disabled based on practice size and needs.
Modules:
1.	OPD/Consultation
o	Features: Appointment scheduling, patient check-ins, consultation records, and reporting.
o	Modular Requirements: Ability to activate or deactivate this module. Ensure integration with other modules when enabled.
2.	Admissions
o	Features: Patient admissions, bed allocation, discharge management, and billing.
o	Modular Requirements: Ability to activate or deactivate this module. Ensure integration with OPD and Laboratory modules.
3.	Laboratory
o	Features: Test requests, results management, and reporting.
o	Modular Requirements: Ability to activate or deactivate this module. Ensure integration with OPD and Admissions modules.
4.	Pharmacy
o	Features: Medication inventory, prescriptions, and billing.
o	Modular Requirements: Ability to activate or deactivate this module. Ensure integration with OPD and Admissions modules.
Implementation:
•	Configuration Settings: Develop a configuration or settings interface where admins can enable or disable each module as needed.
•	Feature Toggles: Implement feature toggles to control the activation status of each module dynamically.
•	Integration: Ensure that when a module is disabled, it does not impact the functionality of other active modules.
3. Patient Flow Management
Objective: Manage the complete patient flow from entry to exit, ensuring a seamless transition between different stages.

Features:
•	Patient Entry: Capture and manage patient details upon entry.
•	Consultation and Admission: Track patient interactions, manage admissions, and ensure integration with Laboratory and Pharmacy modules.
•	Laboratory Tests: Handle test requests and results, integrating with OPD and Admissions modules.
•	Pharmacy Prescriptions: Manage medication orders and prescriptions, integrating with OPD and Admissions modules.
•	Discharge Process: Manage patient discharge, including generating summaries and final billing.
Modular Requirements:
•	Ensure smooth integration between modules to support the full patient flow.
•	Provide administrative tools to monitor and manage patient progress through their treatment journey.
